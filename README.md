# UGR-file-indexing-system
This is a file indexing system for UGR made by Can Gural Tanova

HOW TO MAKE IT WORK:


Have all of the files you want to index in the same folder as the prrogram

If using an existing file table, name it "fileTable" and keep it in the same folder as the program

Once run, the program will prompt you to ask which action you want to take

When providing file names, only give the name, not the extention.
